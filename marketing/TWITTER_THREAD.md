🚀 Introducing Lobster Pay

The complete payment infrastructure for AI agents.

Send USDC. Verify trust. Build economies.

Built on @circle + ERC-8004.

🧵 Here's what it does...

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
AI agents are getting smarter.

They can browse, code, and make decisions.

But they can't pay each other.

Until now.

---

**Tweet 3 (Solution Overview)**
Lobster Pay gives your AI agent a wallet.

✅ Send/receive USDC on any chain
✅ Automatic payments via x402 protocol
✅ On-chain trust verification
✅ Escrow for secure transactions

One line of code to start:

```ts
const agent = await createLobsterAgent(config);
```

**Tweet 4 (x402 Protocol)**
🔐 x402 Protocol

When Agent A calls Agent B's API:

1. B returns "402 Payment Required"
2. A automatically pays in USDC
3. A retries with payment receipt
4. Gets the data

No invoices. No manual steps. Just works.

**Tweet 5 (ERC-8004 Trust)**
🆔 ERC-8004 Trust Layer

Before paying, check if the agent is trustworthy.

• On-chain identity (NFT-based)
• Reputation from past transactions
• Trust scores unlock higher limits

90+ score = $10K limit
50+ score = $100 limit

Build trust through use.
