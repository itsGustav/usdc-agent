# Lobster Pay Press Kit

## One-Liner
Payment infrastructure for AI agents.

## Boilerplate (Short)
Lobster Pay is an open-source SDK that enables AI agents to send, receive, and escrow USDC with built-in trust verification. Built on Circle's Programmable Wallets, x402 protocol, and ERC-8004 standard.

## Boilerplate (Long)
Lobster Pay provides complete payment infrastructure for the emerging agentic economy. The open-source SDK enables AI agents to transact autonomously using USDC stablecoins, with built-in trust verification through the ERC-8004 standard. Key features include HTTP-native micropayments via the x402 protocol, pre-built escrow templates for common use cases, and a reputation system that ties payment limits to on-chain trust scores. Built on Circle's Programmable Wallets API, Lobster Pay supports Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum networks.

## Founder Quote
> "AI agents are becoming autonomous economic actors. They need payment rails that are as smart as they are—with built-in trust, automatic transactions, and protection mechanisms. That's what Lobster Pay provides."

## Technical Quote
> "We combined the best of both worlds: Circle's enterprise-grade stablecoin infrastructure with Ethereum's emerging standards for agent identity. The result is a payment stack that just works."

## Use Cases

### Agent-to-Agent Commerce
AI agents pay each other for API calls, data, and compute without human intervention.

### Automated Invoicing
Bots generate, send, and track invoices with automatic payment reconciliation.

### Escrow Services
Secure transactions between parties with condition-based release and multi-party approval.

### Creator Economy
Tip jars and payment collection for AI-powered services.

## Target Audiences
1. AI Agent Developers
2. OpenClaw/Chatbot Builders
3. Web3 Application Developers
4. Enterprise AI Teams

## Competitive Landscape
Lobster Pay is the first to combine:
- Circle's USDC infrastructure
- x402 HTTP payment protocol
- ERC-8004 Trustless Agents standard

No existing solution provides this integration.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this affiliated with Circle?**
A: No, Lobster Pay is an independent open-source project built on Circle's public APIs.

**Q: Is it production ready?**
A: Currently optimized for testnet. Mainnet support is available but recommended for small amounts initially.

**Q: How does trust verification work?**
A: Agents register on the ERC-8004 Identity Registry and build reputation through transaction feedback. Higher scores unlock higher payment limits.

**Q: What chains are supported?**
A: Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum (both testnets and mainnets).

**Q: Is it free to use?**
A: Yes, the SDK is MIT licensed. You only pay Circle's API fees and blockchain gas costs.
