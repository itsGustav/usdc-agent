## Marketing Messages

### Hero Statement
> "The payment stack for AI agents. Send USDC. Verify trust. Build economies."

### Elevator Pitch (30 sec)
> "Lobster Pay lets AI agents pay each other trustlessly. Built on Circle for USDC payments, x402 for HTTP-native micropayments, and ERC-8004 for on-chain reputation. One line of code to get started. Already supports escrow, invoicing, and multi-chain."

### Technical Pitch (for devs)
> "It's Stripe for AI agents. Drop in our SDK, and your agent can send/receive USDC, handle 402 Payment Required responses automatically, verify counterparty trust via on-chain reputation, and create escrows with pre-built templates. All on testnet today, mainnet ready."
